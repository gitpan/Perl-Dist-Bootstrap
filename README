NAME
    Perl::Dist::Bootstrap - A bootstrap Perl for building Perl distributions

DESCRIPTION
    "Bootstrap Perl" is a Perl distribution, and a member of the "Vanilla
    Perl" series of distributions.

    The Perl::Dist::Bootstrap module can be used to create a bootstrap Perl
    distribution.

    Most of the time nobody will be using Perl::Dist::Bootstrap directly,
    but will be downloading the pre-built installer for Bootstrap Perl from
    the Vanilla Perl website at <http://vanillaperl.com/>.

    For people building Win32 Perl distributions based on Perl::Dist, one
    gotcha is that the distributions have hard-coded install paths.

    As a result of this, it is not possible to use a distribution to build a
    new/modified version of the same distribution.

    To compensate for this, and make the process of building custom
    distributions easier, this distribution has been created.

    As an additional convenience, Bootstrap Perl comes with Perl::Dist, and
    several distribution subclasses (Perl::Dist::Vanilla,
    Perl::Dist::Strawberry etc) already installed, as well as some
    additional Perl development tools that might be useful during the Perl
    distribution creation process.

  CONFIGURATION
    Bootstrap Perl must be installed in C:\strawberry-perl. The executable
    installer adds the following environment variable changes:

        * adds directories to PATH
            - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\bin
            - C:\strawberry-perl\dmake\bin
            - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw
            - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\bin

        * adds directories to LIB
            - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\lib
            - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\bin

        * adds directories to INCLUDE 
            - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\include
            - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\lib\CORE
            - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\lib\encode

    LIB and INCLUDE changes are likely more than are necessary, but attempt
    to head off potential problems compiling external programs for use with
    Perl.

    The first time that the "cpan" program is run, users will be prompted
    for configuration settings. With the defaults provided in Strawberry
    Perl, users may answer "no" to manual configuration and the installation
    should still work.

    Manual CPAN configuration may be repeated by running the following
    command:

        perl -MCPAN::FirstTime -e "CPAN::FirstTime::init"
